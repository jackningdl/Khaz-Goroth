# Khaz-Goroth

> Khaz'goroth, shaper of mountains and canyons, is a male Vanir Titan and the ultimate craftsman. He is a master of many arts and disciplines; with Eonar's help, he created Azeroth's dwarves, troggs, and perhaps, mountain giants. He crafted the mountains in which the Ironforge dwarves dwell — their kingdom’s name, Khaz Modan, means “mountains of Khaz.” A fiery, brooding entity, Khaz’goroth loves working at his forge and listening to tales of heroism and valor.
